# Java_Fullstack_Developement_Challenge

Overview:
Welcome to the Java Full-Stack Development Challenge repository! This undertaking is an ongoing effort to enhance and showcase my Java programming skills through documenting my journey. As part of this challenge, I will be continuously working on various aspects of Java development, including backend services, frontend interfaces, and integration points.

Repository Purpose:
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the Java Full-Stack Development challenge. It is intended to:
*Document my development process and coding practices, which may come in handy in future.
*Provide a resource for others who are learning or seeking to improve their Java FSD skills.
*Share useful code snippets, patterns, and solutions with the wider developer community.

Project Structure:
Backend: Java Spring Boot applications, RESTful APIs, and database interactions.
Frontend: Integration with Java-based UI technologies, if applicable, or other front-end frameworks.
Documentation: Detailed notes, instructions, and explanations related to each stage of development will be included as comments in each src file.

Updates:
The repository will be updated frequently as I progress through the challenge. Each update will include new features, bug fixes, and improvements, along with detailed commit messages explaining the changes made.
